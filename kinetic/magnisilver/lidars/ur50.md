<H4 style="color:red">When changing out sensors makes sure to disconnect the RED battery cable from the batteries and wait 2 minutes so high voltage and current are not linked with the main board!</H4>

**This tutorial is intended for magni_robot branch: [indigo-devel](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/magni_robot/tree/indigo-devel/) and ROS Kinetic.**

## Installation

Connect the lidar lan cable into Raspberry Pi lan port and the power supply connector into the right molex connector on the MCB board:

Using 4xM3 screws, the lidar can be mounted on the top plate that comes with Magni robot

<!-- TODO image -->

Now the batteries can be reconnected and the robot powered on.

### Default location

The default location of the lidar is on the top plate looking into the forward direction (lidar connector is turned backward). Top plate of newer robots comes ready with holes for lidar mounting. But some of the older versions don't have those holes. In that case please either contact Ubiquity Robotics to supply you with a new top plate OR use double sided tape to mount the lidar. If you chose to mount the lidar with the double sided tape please make sure its 1.) turned exactly forward - a slight offset in angle can result in inaccurate localization and 2.) its center is EXACTLY the position shown on the picture.

On the picture red, green, blue correspond to x, y and z axis. Lidar is the component that says 'laser' on the image (lidars are sometimes also called lasers)

## Advanced: Changing LIDAR internal IP settings
**Warning: IPs are changed from their defaults, it is highly likely nothing will work out of the box with Ubiquity Robotics products.**

If buying a lidar from Ubiquity Robotics, the lidar will come pre-set with the IPs that were used in these tutorials:
 - LIDAR IP: **192.168.42.222**
 - IP to which lidar is connected (workstation IP): **192.168.42.125**

If you want to change those lidar-internal IPs [here](https://workdrive.zohoexternal.com/external/af682a9813143dc25804ba5ba415776213005cdf5fdd94ef796800ca6ba3132f) is a video about how to do that.

Additionally to whats shown on the video, make sure:

1. First make sure you have WinPcap installed (sourced [here](https://workdrive.zohoexternal.com/external/4b6aefb568cd674dfd5b0fa846535897202c93a31b5de5bad275020bc7c29560) or download from the internet)
2. Follow the steps shown on the video to change the LIDAR IP, but a couple of notes:
    - in the video PC IP  is changed from 192.168.1.125 to 192.168.42.125. This was done because often external network is also on the subnet 192.168.1.xxx and this creates problems with the internet connection. 
    - in the video the IP is changed to 192.168.42.125 -> this is arbitrary and can be any IP

## Setup to work with RaspberryPi

### Network
The lidar should come pre-configured with static IP: 192.168.42.222 and only answering to requests coming from IP 192.168.42.125, so we need to configure that on the RPI.

A static interface needs to be set on RPIs lan port by editing the interfaces file

    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

we need the eth0 interface to have a static address of 192.168.42.125/24:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.42.125/24 #this IP may depend on your lidar settings
    gateway 0.0.0.0
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8

### Compiling

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/LS-Technical-Supporter/LS-LIDAR-N301ROS.git
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    

### Running

    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch lslidar_n301_decoder lslidar_n301_config.launch device_IP:=192.168.42.222
    

### Default lidar extrinsics

The lidar position that is going to be loaded when robot starts up can be set in  `/etc/ubiquity/robot.yaml`:

    sudo nano /etc/ubiquity/robot.yaml

which should, among other things also contain:

    lidar_installed: True


### Example: Adding a custom lidar location

If the lidar is set in a different position, readjust its coordinates in the [urdf files](https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/magni_robot/blob/4c43300e4fc08a37f5206c9db85a6e11105f91d6/magni_description/urdf/magni.urdf.xacro#L205). Example:

    <origin xyz="0 0.1 0.4" rpy="0 0 0"/> <!--change lidar pose here-->
